                <h2>HTML – My First Building Block 🧱</h2>
                <p>HTML is the basic language used to make websites. It stands for HyperText Markup Language.</p>
                <p>With HTML, we can add text, images, links, and more to a webpage. It’s like giving structure to your
                    ideas!</p>
                <p>My first web page had my name and a picture. It felt amazing to create something on my own!</p>

            <div class="divider"></div>


            <section id="CSS">
                <h2>Falling for CSS – Styling Like a Queen 👑</h2>
                <p>Once HTML laid the foundation, CSS came along like fairy dust ✨. Colors, borders, fonts — suddenly my
                    plain web pages became artboards.</p>
                <p>I discovered Flexbox and thought, "WOW!" But then CSS Grid entered the chat and changed everything.
                    My layouts became sleek, sassy, and responsive. 😎</p>

            <section id="Javascript">
                <h2>Struggling with JavaScript – The Plot Twist 😵</h2>
                <p>Oh JS, you tricky wizard. My first time dealing with `variables`, `arrays`, and `functions` felt like
                    solving Hogwarts-level riddles.</p>
                <p>But every time I made a button do something cool, I felt like a magician. Slowly, loops and
                    conditions started making sense... sort of. Still working on mastering you, dear JS. 🧙‍♀️</p>

            <section id="Project">
                <h2>Why I Made My Portfolio 💼</h2>
                <p>I wanted to show the world what I can do! From designing in Figma to writing code, I created a space
                    that truly represents *me*.</p>
                <p>Having a portfolio helps me apply for internships, connect with other creatives, and track my growth
                    as a developer and designer.</p>

            <section id="Future">
                <h2>What’s Next for Me? 🚀</h2>
                <p>I’ll keep adding new projects to my portfolio and improving my code. Maybe even learn React or host
                    it with a custom domain!</p>
                <p>This is just the beginning — and I’m excited for what’s ahead! 🌟</p>
